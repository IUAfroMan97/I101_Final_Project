            <h3>Solution :</h3>
            <p>The food truck owners that asked us for help connecting with customers, have been upfront and have told us that they are not technologically savvy. Thus, we have developed a low maintenance, intuitive app for them to use to market their brand.
                But, not only will this app address our food truck’s problems, it could be the solution for all of Bloomington’s food trucks.</p>
            <p>Our app, Find My Food Truck, will include a map with Bloomington food truck locations that updates in real time. A potential customer will then be able to tap on a food truck and see the menu. We will also incorporate the different companies’
                social media pages on the app, so customers can see what others think about the quality of the food and whether it is worth the price they paid, aiding them in their decision of where to eat. And finally, we are also going to include a
                third-party mobile payment service in the app so that customers can easily pay for their food without having to worry too much about having cash, credit cards, etc. on them.</p>
            <p>Social media will provide a platform for the food trucks to connect with people while the GPS system will drum up interest with consumers, allowing them to know where the food truck is at any point in time. And finally, the addition of a third-party
                mobile payment system will allow easier and more efficient payment transactions and allow trucks to set up rewarding payment systems to grow and strengthen their business.</p>
            <p>We believe that these three components are vital for Bloomington’s food trucks’ success because they allow for customers to gather information about the food trucks in the area, conveniently, but also allow food truck owners to easily market
                their brand and make their name known in the Bloomington area.</p>
            <p>Because Bloomington is a college town, our target audience mainly includes students and professors. We believe that they will be drawn to our app because it conveniently allows a person to locate and connect with all of Bloomington’s food
                trucks through one, easy to use app. </p>
            <p>As urban centers tend to grow as consumers, with proper technological advancements, so will the food truck trend. Incorporating the technologies mentioned above into our app will allow for not only ease of understanding for the food truck
                owners, but also the technological advancements necessary for a food truck to profit in a consumer society.</p>
