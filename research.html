            <h3>Primary Research :&nbsp;</h3>
            <p>Food trucks are a large part of a college campus’ community. We created a survey and sent it out to college kids asking four simple questions. If they buy from food trucks, how often, if they follow food trucks on social media, and if they
                would download an app connecting them to food trucks. We found that overall, college students respond positively to having an app that connects them with food trucks. We also found that with this app, interest in buying from food trucks
                and connecting with them on social media increases. </p>
            <h3>Secondary Sources :</h3>
            <p>Food trucks have been an important part of big cities since the early 2000s. According to proponents of these food trucks, they “activate public space” and “foster a sense of community” (Wessel 2012) by connecting to the people through social
                media. The trend started when small businesses realized that they could use Twitter and other such platforms in order to “expose their services” (Wessel 2012). According to Wessel, because social media services are free, food truck vendors
                use these to their advantage by using them as “marketing tool to communicate to a localized audience their latest location in a city, daily or hourly menu items, or if they are sold out or out of service” (2012). Although food trucks initially
                had problems determining how to market, most vendors now use social media due because of its ease and mobility. Furthermore, according to an article, published in 2016, how we perceive food is not only linked to taste, but also how visually
                appealing it is (Bruijnes, Huisman, &amp; Heylen 2016). Because of this, a good way to market the food trucks’ brand is to upload pictures of the food they serve to the food trucks’ social media pages so that when people access the app
                they see the pictures of the food and decide to give the food truck a chance.</p>
            <p>Another important feature that our food truck app will have is a GPS tracking system. The Mumbai Educational Trust wrote an article in which they described the steps required to utilize a GPS tracking service to monitor the location of a bus
                wanting to be used for transportation (Manganakar 2013). They mention a small summary of the history of GPS and the required hardware for powering a connected system to utilize the technology. They also give some details as to how the
                algorithm for computing the location of a GPS device through the use of at least three US based satellites and triangulation of the location between them.</p>
            <p>And finally, mobile payment services are becoming increasingly more popular as technology advances and mobile usage increases. According to the article “Understanding consumer acceptance of mobile payment services: An empirical analysis”,
                people generally respond positively to using mobile payment services in everyday life (Schierz et. al. 2009). The high accessibility, compatibility and mobility increases people's’ desires to use mobile payments and encourages businesses
                to incorporate them into their payment strategies. However, security is also a huge issue for using online/mobile payments. Despite its attractions, a large percentage of the population does not use mobile payments because of fear of security.
                Although many companies have secure structures and data transactions, it is hard to achieve this especially as a small business owner. Making your own mobile payment service is extremely difficult and will deter consumers from wanting
                to use the product so it is easier and smarter to use a third party company when using mobile payments.</p>
            <h3>Documentation :</h3>
            <p>Our team tackled this problem in stages. Initially, we brainstormed and put together general characteristics we wanted our app to have. Combining modern technology with general consumer related knowledge we designed the hypothetical app. From
                there we found research articles and narrowed down what was applicable and possible. We adapted our ideas and redesigned the app based on what was actually plausible. When we went to put together our ideas in the end, the work that we
                had done throughout the duration of the project really came together and provided us with a good structure that we were then able to branch off of.</p>
            <p>Our team worked well with this strategy. We are all creative and insightful and were able to adapt to problems that arose along the way. We were all able to bring different ideas to the table, allowing us to see the problem from all perspectives
                and foresee issues that may arise. In the future, our team could define roles and divide work better. We were very efficient; however a better organization tactic could have increased efficiency.</p>
